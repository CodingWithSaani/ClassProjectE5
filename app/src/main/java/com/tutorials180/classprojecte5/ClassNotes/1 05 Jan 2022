1) How to access user device's location using GPS


Steps to achieve CLO1
step 1: Add permission to manifest file
          i)FINE_LOCATION
         ii)COARSE_LOCATION
        iii)INTERNET

Step 2: Add dependency to your build.gradle(app)
        implementation 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-location:19.0.0'

Step 3: Add new package for new concept
Step 4: Add an activity to work and display location details. (LocationWorkingActivity)

Step 5:
         i)Add Button view to get LAT and LNG from device on XML
        ii)Add TextView to show LAT on XML
       iii)Add TextView to show LNG on XML

Step 6: Declare and initialize ViewBinding object to get all views from the XML (activity_location_working.xml) in Kotlin file. (LocationWorkingActivity.kt)
Step 7: Declare and initialize LocationManager class's object.

Step 8: Implement LocationListener interface and implement its method onLocationChanged() in your activity LocationWorkingActivity
Step 9: Implement onClickListener with lwGetLatLngBtn.

Step10: Call user define fun getDeviceLocation() inside onClickListener of lwGetLatLngBtn
Step11: Working with getDeviceLocation() function
        11.1) Add try-catch block
        11.2) Call requestLocationUpdates() fun with object LocationManger class
        11.3) Add permission check before the call of requestLocationUpdates()
        11.4) Call ActivityCompat.requestPermissions() to request the access of "access_fine_location" from user
              inside permission check
        11.5) override onRequestPermissionsResult() function in LocationWorkingActivity
              <>This method will contain the result of the permission you have requested from the user using the requestPermission function.

Step12: Show the lat and lng into onLocationChanged function.
